Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its external outputs, and 
it is a key aspect of monitoring and debugging distributed systems such as the esthesis IoT platform. 

esthesis CORE comes preconfigured to support distributed logging, metrics, and traces, following industry best practices
and standards. In the following section you can find more information on how to configure and use these features. If you
are looking for a deeper explanations of how these features are integrated into esthesis CORE, you can also read
