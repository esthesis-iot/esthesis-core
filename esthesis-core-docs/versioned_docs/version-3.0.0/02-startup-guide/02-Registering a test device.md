# Registering a test device
Before start registering real devices, it is a good idea to test the platform with a test device.
You can register a test device and enable its "demo mode" to start receiving data right away.

## Prepare the platform for new devices registration
Check that esthesis Core is configured to accept new device registrations in
Settings > Device registration > Registration mode. You can set it to "Open registration" for now,
but do not forget to change it to a more secure setting later.
