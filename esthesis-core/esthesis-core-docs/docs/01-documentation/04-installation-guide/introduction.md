# Introduction

esthesis CORE is a cloud native application that can be deployed in a variety ways, using:

- Kubernetes: This is the officially supported installation method, allowing to deploy all
components in a Kubernetes cluster. The installation is based on Helm charts, providing you ample
configuration options to customize the deployment to your needs.
- Openshift: esthesis CORE can be deployed on Openshift using the same Helm charts as for Kubernetes.
- Virtual Appliance: esthesis CORE can be deployed as a virtual appliance, which is a preconfigured
virtual machine image that can be deployed on a virtualization platform. The virtual appliance should
be used for evaluation purposes only.
